# Python 01: Linear Programs.

**Introduction**: This document presents learning steps for Python 01. In Python 01, you will learn the elements of Python to build your first interactive linear program. We define a linear program as a flow of sequential instructions without branching and loops. At the end of Python 01, you will be able to implement a program where a user can enter simple inputs and the program calculates and prints the results as its output.

**Note:** In Python 01, exercises and examples can be executed using:

1. Online Python Editor **OPyEditor**: The final program should be stored on your local machine.
2. Local Python Package (see ExtraStep-01): Using **BRef-01: Appendix B** Python can be installed on your local machine.

## Materials:

The activities are designed based on these following references:

## Path:

Follow the following steps:

### Step-01: What is a Program?

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. understand the concept of (computer and non-computer) programs.
	2. experience your first taste of Python without knowing all the details.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Use **BRef-01: Chapter 01** and **BRef-02: Chapter 02** as a reference and discuss the following questions:
   1. What is a general definition of a program? Provide some (non-computer) examples.
   2. What are the main elements of a (Python) program?
   3. How Python runs programs?
   4. **First Taste of Python**: Read section *Little Programs* and analyze the provided examples.
   5. Consider the following Python programs and guess what each program does. Analyze and discuss inputs, behaviour and expected outputs.
   		- *Note*: Certainly there are lines that you won't understand. The goal is to evaluate your first taste of Python programs and check how intuitive they are. You will be learning all details in later stages.

```python
#Code 01:
words = []
num_str = input("How many words would you like to enter?")
num = int(num_str)
for _ in range(0, num):
	word = input("Next word: ")
  	words.append(word)
print("This is your list of words:", words)
```

#### Exercises:

1. Make a small research to understand the meaning of *syntax in programming*. Give three examples of the programs you have read in **BRef-01: Chapter 01**.
2. Take each of the given following Python programs and carry out these steps:
	- Write down syntactical elements that are understandable for you.
	- Specify statements that you know (or you can guess) the results of the their execution.
	- Share your lists within your learning group.
	- Discuss what will be the result / output of the program (without execution).

*Note*: It is not expected that students understand all the elements of these programs. The main goal is to get a taste of Python programs and discuss about them. *Trust your intuition*.

```python
#Code 02f
a = 16
b = 12
b = a
a = 22
print(a)
print(b)
# what will be printed here?
```
	
```python
#Code 03
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if num < 0:
   print("Enter a positive number")
else:
   sum = 0
   while num > 0:
       sum += num
       num -= 1
   print("Result is", sum)
```
	
```python
#Code 04
import random
print(random.randint(0, 9))
```
	
```python
#Code 05
my_str = input("Enter a string: ")
words = [word.lower() for word in my_str.split()]
words.sort()
print("The sorted words are:")
for word in words:
	print(word)
```


3. Using **OPyEditor** try to execute the given programs. Does the output of the programs match your expectations?

### Step-02: Everything starts with Data.

#### Goals:

```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. understand values, variables, primitive data types (int, str, float, boolean).
	2. understand the concept of mutability (some data types are mutable and some are not).
	3. implement Python programs containing variables, assigning values, print.
	4. interpret and implement basic operations of strings: concatenation (combining), duplicating, scanning and slicing.
```

#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 02** explore the answers for the following questions: 
*Note: There are some concepts (like objects, classes, references) that students may not be able to grasp completely. The main idea is to try as much as possible. They will be more clear later when they learn Object Oriented programming in Python.*
   1. What is a value? What is a variable?
   2. What is a *type*? Provide five examples.
   3. How can you define a variable in Python? 
   4. Define some variables in Python that are not permitted in Python. Experiment with breaking various rules in defining variables. Analyse the error message.
   5. How can you assign a value to a variable? How can we express that two items are equal?
   6. How can you identify the type of a value / variable?
   
4. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 05** discuss and experiment the following questions:
   1. What are the character and text string types in Python? Make examples. 
   2. How can you combine several strings? Implement an example.
   3. Can you multiply a number with a string? What is the result? Implement an example.
   4. How can you get the 5th character of a given string? How can you get the first character?
   5. How can you get a substring from a given string? For example, the zipcodes (postcodes) in The Netherlands consist of 4 digits followed by 2 letters. How can you extract the letters from a given zipcode?
   6. You have learned how to print something as an output of your program. How can you read something as input? What is the *function*? What is the type?


#### Exercises:

1. Check the following program and write down what will be the result of the prints:

```python
x = 12
y = 15
z = 1
y = z
z = 12
y = 13
x = y 
y = x
z = 7
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
```
2. A phone number is a number. Yet we would want to save it as a text. Can you think of a reason why?
3. The number in the address of your house, for example Kerkweg **8**, is a number. Yet we would want to save it as a text. Can you think of a reason why?
4. What is an example from a number we use in the real world that we want to save as a number in Python, not as a text.
5. User input in Python is always considered a text, even if we just enter numbers, why would it act like this?
6. Define a variable called zipcode (postcode) and give it the value of your own zipcode. Print it using print().
7. Define a variable called favorite_food, give it the value "Pizza". Print it. Change the value to "Roti". Print it. 
8. Define a variable that stores your school email address. Extract your student number from this email address. 
9. Write down the complete alphabet in a variable. Split it halfway over two different variables. Join them back together in the wrong order and print it. 
10. Explain in your own words with an ```f``` string is?
11. Finish all the exercises listed in **BRef-01-Chapter 02: Things to Do** and Practice the exercises listed in **BRef-01-Chapter 05: Things to Do**.

#### Goals:
```
After taking this step, you will be able to:
	1. understand the main arithmetic operations in Python.
	2. implement arithmetic expressions in Python.
	3. convert one primitive data type to another using functions: int(), float(), str(), bool().
	4. implement Python programs containing: input from the user, type conversion, calculation, printing.
```
#### What to Learn?

1. Using **BRef-01: Chapter 03** answer the following questions:
   1. Name basic built-in data types in Python. Use examples.
   2. What are the basic arithmetic operations? Make a list with the meaning (semantics) of each operation.
   3. Why is *precedence* an important concept? Make examples.
   4. How can you convert one data type to another? Name basic built-in functions.

#### Exercises:

2. Do the same for subtraction, division and multiplication.
3. Get input from the user. Save it as a number. Print it.
4. Try to divide something by zero. Describe the error you get.
5. Create two variables with text in them. Print them togeter at once, using only 1 print statement.
6. Python uses PEMDAS. What is that and is it different from the way you learned it?
7. Create one calculation using at least four parentheses, three multiplications and four subtractions. Print the result.
8. Finish all the exercises listed in **BRef-01-Chapter 03: Things to Do**.


## Code Analysis


1. Analyze the programming solutions given below and write down in one sentence: what do they do? What problems do they try to solve?

```python
# Code Analysis 1
# Inputs
a = int(input("enter value A: "))
b = int(input("enter value B: "))

# Processing
t = a
a = b
b = t

# Outputs
print("A =", a)
print("B =", b)
```

```python
# Code Analysis 2

# Inputs
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Processing
dig = num % 10

# Outputs
print(dig)
```

2. Implementing a solution for a given problem is challenging for a starting programmer. It is helpful to have a guideline with some steps. Check [this guideline](./checklist_metacog.pdf) and apply it the Problem 5 of this week. *Hint: A template with some examples provided [here](./template.py)*

3.  One of the students has tried to apply the guideline for a given problem. But, the code does not produce the expected results. Check the code and without executing the code try to find the mistake.

```python
# Ask the user for the name of item X.
# Then ask the user for the price of item X.
# Finally, ask the user for desired quantity of item X.
# Based on input, calculate how much you have to pay.
# Write the message in the form:
#   "To purchase N units of X you must pay M euros."


# Inputs
name = input("Input the name of item X: ")

price = input("What is the price of", name, "? ")

quantity = input("How many units of", name, "do you want to buy? ")

# Processing
total = price * quantity

# Outputs
print("To purchase", quantity, "units of", name, "you must pay", total, "euros.")
```
